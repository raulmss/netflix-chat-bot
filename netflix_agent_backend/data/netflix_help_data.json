      "When you create your Netflix account, or add anew profilein your account, we ask you to choose a few titles that you like. We use these titles to “jump start” your recommendations. Choosing a few titles you like is optional. If you choose to forego this step then we will start you off with a diverse and popular set of titles to get you going.",
      "Once you start engaging with titles on the service, this will “supersede” any initial preferences you provided us. As you continue to enjoy Netflix over time, the titles you engage with more recently will outweigh titles you engaged with in the past in terms of driving our recommendations system.",

      "the choice of row (such as Continue Watching)",
      "which titles appear in the row, and",
      "the order of those titles.",
      "The most recommended titles go to the top. The most strongly recommended titles start on the left of each row and go right -- unless you have selected Arabic or Hebrew as your language in our systems, in which case these will go right to left.",
      "We take feedback from every visit to the Netflix service (for example, what titles you start watching, if you finish those titles, and how you rate those titles, such as thumbs up) and continually update our algorithms with those signals to improve the accuracy of their prediction of what you’re most likely to watch. Our data, algorithms, and computation systems continue to feed into each other to produce fresh recommendations so that your Netflix experience remains relevant and helpful.",
